# Azure Labs Portfolio

This Azure Labs portfolio represents my hands-on learning journey as a Senior IT Support Specialist expanding into cloud technologies. My professional background includes enterprise remote support, identity and access workflows, and collaboration on Single Sign-On (SSO) integrations and system migrations.

These labs are designed to bridge real-world operational experience with modern cloud concepts, focusing on identity management, deployment practices, troubleshooting workflows, and infrastructure fundamentals relevant to enterprise environments.

### Lab 02 — Custom Domain Setup
Configuration of a custom domain in Microsoft Entra ID, including DNS setup and validation steps.

> **Note:**  
> DNS configuration was completed successfully; however, Azure domain verification remained pending due to platform-side validation delays. This lab documents the full process and reflects a real-world scenario where verification may take extended time.
