# Lab 03 — Create Admin Users and Enable MFA

This lab covers creating administrative users in Microsoft Entra ID and enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).  
MFA is a foundational security control and is typically one of the first requirements in any enterprise Azure environment.

This lab uses the default `onmicrosoft.com` domain to avoid dependency on custom domain verification.

**Security Note:**  
In production environments, Global Administrator access should be tightly restricted.

## Step 4 — Sign In as the New Admin User
1. Open a private/incognito browser window
2. Go to https://portal.azure.com
3. Sign in as: admin@jsfrancislegacy.onmicrosoft.com
4. Change the temporary password when prompted

## Step 5 — Register Microsoft Authenticator for MFA
During the first sign-in, the user is prompted to configure security information.

1. Select **Microsoft Authenticator app** as the authentication method
2. Complete the registration process using the Authenticator mobile app
3. Approve the test notification to finalize setup

## Step 6 — Confirm MFA Configuration

1. Return to **Microsoft Entra ID**
2. Navigate to **Users**
3. Open the administrative user account
4. Select **Authentication methods**

This view confirms that authentication methods are managed for the user and that MFA registration has been completed.

## Lab Completed
You now have:
- A dedicated administrative account
- Multi-Factor Authentication registered and enforced
- Verified authentication methods for privileged access

This establishes a secure baseline for implementing Conditional Access policies.
