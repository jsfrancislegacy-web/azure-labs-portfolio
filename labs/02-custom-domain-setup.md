🧪 Lab 02 — Custom Domain Setup
Overview

In this lab, we configure a custom domain for our Microsoft Entra ID tenant.

Steps

Add the Custom Domain:
We added jsfrancislegacy.com as a custom domain in Entra ID.

Create the TXT Record in DNS:
We set the provided TXT record in Namecheap’s DNS panel.

Verification Delay Note:
Due to ongoing Azure propagation or verification delays, the domain may not verify immediately. In a real-world scenario, this can happen and might require additional time or a re-attempt of the verification process. For the purpose of this lab, the steps have been completed as required, and the domain is pending Azure’s final verification.

Conclusion

We have successfully configured the custom domain on our end and noted that verification may take additional time. Once Azure completes verification, the domain will be fully active.
